here is my python project, the goal is to crete a web scrapper that will grab all "copy paste" commands from a guide website and string them together in the
command line. the goal is to provide a search prompt that allows you to get command line tools wrapped into one bundle and execute it all at once without
needing to read throgh articles and sift through adds on pages, it just grabs the "copy buttons" contense and strings them all together.
